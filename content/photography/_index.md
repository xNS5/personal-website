# Photography

Thanks to my dad I’ve developed (no pun inten—who am I kidding I meant to do that) into a bit of a shutterbug! An issue I came across early into my foray into the world of 35mm and APSC sensors is how to afford lenses. 
To those who may not know, lenses are E X P E N S I V E. Some nicer lenses with sensors, motors, aperture (f-stop), can easily go for $1,000+ and I’m clearly not made of money. Then, I discovered the existence of lens adaptors. 
There are some gorgeous, functioning lenses that are comparatively affordable and can work with any digital camera.

My absolute favorite lens is my 85mm f1.8 Nikon lens. My dad gave it to me along with my favorite film camera – a Nikon FM2, given to my mother by her father when she first came to the US.

I’ve had a lot of fun exploring my little corner of the PNW. I’ve gone to not-so-secret coves, seen Seattle from the giant Ferris wheel and walked in the tulip fields in Mt. Vernon. While there is still a lot for me to see, I think I’ve found my corner of the sky.
