# Hi, I'm Michael
I am a graduate of Western Washington University's Computer Science program with a Communication Studies minor. I'm an inquisitive, tenacious, and detail oriented individual who enjoys any opportunity to further his knowledge and abilities. Through my education, I've been fortunate to have worked on all types of projects â€” ranging from mobile applications, video games, web development, to systems development. I am currently open to work, and any opportunities which allow me to grow as a professional and my skills as a software developer.

In my free time, I enjoy exploring Washington, playing classical guitar, photography, and tinkering with my home lab. Photography allows me to shut off that part of my brain that wants to be analytical and allows me to enjoy the natural beauty of my surroundings. I've been playing guitar for most of my life, and I enjoy the elegance of classical music.

My home lab has allowed me to develop my own server infrastructure using a combination of pfSense and Proxmox, and helped me leverage my admittedly limited networking knowledge.
