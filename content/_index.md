# Hi, I'm Michael!

I’m a 4th year Computer Science student at Western Washington University (WWU), and this website is…well, all about me!
I’m originally from Pacific Grove, California, but I somehow wound up in Bellingham, Washington for school. I have a myriad of hobbies (thank you, ADHD) that keep me going and curious about the world.
