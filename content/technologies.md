title = "Technologies I've Used"

So far in  my education I've had the opportunity to use Java, C#, C, Flutter (Dart), Javascript + HTML/CSS, and Python. More recently, I've had the most experience doing projects in C -- more by accident than choice. 
In order, I took Computer Systems II, Operating Systems, Compiler Theory, and Networks all in C. 

I think the easiest language I've worked with thus far is Flutter. The structure of the code is hierarchical, and it's very easy to throw together a functioning application in a short amount of time. Flutter is by far the easiest 
language I've picked up, and I developed ReLeave in a matter of months with a team of students who had never interacted with the language before. 

Javascript + HTML/CSS was heavily used in my capstone project [WWU ACE](/projects/axe/) along with a splash of Python. This is the most polished project that I have worked on thus far.
