So far in my educational and professional career, I've had the opportunity to use Java, C#, C, Flutter (Dart), Javascript + HTML/CSS, and Python.

At my previous position with Heritage Bank NW, I worked full-stack on their Java back-end server as well as their React.js front-end application. The majority of my education involved algorithms, data structures, and less on UX/UI to the point where I've developed a preference for more back-end technologies.

The easiest language I've worked with thus far is Flutter. The structure of the code is hierarchical, and it's very easy to throw together a functioning application in a short amount of time. For example, I developed ReLeave in a matter of months with a team of students who had never interacted with the language before. Flutter has a lot of potential with a ton of community support, and it's incredibly easy for new software developers to see their application ideas become reality.
