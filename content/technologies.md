So far in my educational and professional career, I've had the opportunity to use Java, C#, C, Flutter (Dart), Javascript (several flavors of React/Node), and Python.

At my previous position with Heritage Bank NW, I worked full-stack on their Java back-end server as well as their React.js front-end application. The majority of my education involved algorithms, data structures, and less on UX/UI to the point where I've developed a preference for more back-end technologies. With that said, I'm fully capable of working on either end of the application. I enjoy learning new things, however it's easier for me to learn if there's a tangible result that comes from it. For example I'm currently working on a project using Next.js that seeks to help [first-time renters](https://github.com/xNS5/rentalreviews) in the Bellingham area. I was at one point a first-time renter, and I want to use my skills as a software engineer to help others.

The easiest language I've worked with thus far is Flutter. The structure of the code is hierarchical, and it's very easy to throw together a functioning application in a short amount of time. For example, I developed ReLeave in a matter of months with a team of students who had never interacted with the language before. Flutter has a lot of potential with a ton of community support, and it's incredibly easy for new software developers to see their application ideas become reality.
