title = "Languages I've Used"
+++

So far in  my education I've had the opportunity to use Java, C#, C, Flutter (Dart), Javascript + HTML/CSS, and Python. More recently, I've had the most experience doing projects in C -- more by accident than choice. 
In order, I took Computer Systems II, Operating Systems, Compiler Theory, and Networks all in C. It's an interesting language, but I've had to find creative ways to write C on a computer running macOS. 

The easiest language I've worked with thus far is Flutter. The structure of the code is hierarchical, and it's very easy to throw together a functioning application in a short amount of time. For example, I developed ReLeave in a matter of months with 
a team of students who had never interacted with the language before. It is however a new language that is still experiencing growing pains. This language has a lot of potential with a ton of community support, and it's incredibly easy for
new software developers to see their application ideas become reality.

Javascript + HTML/CSS was heavily used in my capstone project [WWU ACE](/projects/axe/) along with a splash of Python. This is the most polished project that I have worked on thus far. Feel free to check out
