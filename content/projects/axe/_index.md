## About the Project

This project was my capstone project during my senior year at Western Washington University. I led a team of 4 in the development of an accessibility testing program for Daman Wandke of [Wandke Consulting](https://wandke.com/), an accessibility consulting company
in Bellingham, WA. My team and I spent a year working on a full-stack application to streamline their website accessibility evaluation process. Initially, they used Deque Labs' aXe browser extension to determine whether a given webpage conforms to the World Wide Web Consortium's
Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG). From there, they manually entered the data from the accessibility scan into a CSV file, added some comments such as information about the specific WCAG violation, how to remedy that specific violation, and any other relevant notes.
